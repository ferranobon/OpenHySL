 * \brief Routines for parsing INI type configuration files.
 *
 * Routines for reading INI type configuration files. It supports configuration files with section names
 * and therefore it can distinguish two variables of identical name but that are placed in different sections.
 * The supported types are: integer, float, double and string. A typical configuration file is as follows:
 *
 * \warning The routines are case sensitive.
 *
 * \verbatim
 * # Lines that begin with # are treated as comments.
 * [Rayleigh]                       # A section is identified by a word between [ and ]
 * Alpha = 0.197                    # This is a floating point variable, either double or float. It can also be treated like a string.
 * Beta = 0.0000929
 *
 * # Newmark Alpha and Beta values
 * [Newmark]
 * Gamma = 0.5
 * Beta = 0.25                      # This variable is not the same as the one in Rayleigh section
 *
 * [FileNames]
 * Mass_Matrix = "504DOF Mass.txt"   # The double quotes are ignored and only the text in between is stored. This is the safest way to
 *                                   # input strings.
