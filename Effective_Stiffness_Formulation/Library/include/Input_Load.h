/**
 * \brief Given load vector form and a ground measurement, a excitation vector is generated. MPI version.
 *
 * This routine applies a ground motion measurement (displacement, velocity or acceleration) into a load
 * vector form. The output of this routine will be a vector with the specified measurement value applied to
 * those parts of the load vector form that are different to 0.0. In this way, only the desired degrees of
 * freedom (or system equations) will have an be external load applied. The output is ready to be used in
 * calculating the input load as relative (InputLoad_RelValues_MPI()) or absolute values
 * (InputLoad_AbsValues_MPI()). Therefore if the following \c LoadForm is considered:
 *
 * <tt>LoadForm = {1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 -2.0
 *                 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 -2.0
 *                             ....
 *                 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 -2.0}</tt>
 *
 * the resulting \c LoadVector if the ground measurement is \c A would be:
 *
 * <tt>LoadVector = {A A A 0.0 0.0 -2.0*A
 *                   A A A 0.0 0.0 -2.0*A
 *                             ....
 *                   A A A 0.0 0.0 -2.0*A}</tt>
 *
 * \pre 
 * - All elements of type \c MatrixVector_t must be properly initialised through the MatrixVector_Create()
 *   routine.
 * - The dimensions of the vectors  must be the identical.
 * - In \c LoadForm the equivalent elements of the degrees of freedom to be excited must have a value
 *   different than 0.
 *
 * \param[in]  LoadForm   A load vector form.
 * \param[in]  Value      The desired ground measurement to be applied.
 * \param[out] LoadVector The load vector.
 *
 * \post \c LoadVector is the result of multiplying the \c LoadForm vector by the given ground measurement. It
 *       is ready to be used in calculating the input load as relative (InputLoad_RelValues_MPI()) or absolute
