/**
 * \brief Main routine to communicate with OpenFresco remote facilities.
 *
 * This routine handles several aspects of the communication of a OpenFresco. It covers the aspects of set-up
 * and sending/receiving messages. This is achieved through the \c WhatToDo variable.
 *
 * \pre
 * - An OpenFresco server must be waiting for connections.
 * - \c Remote must be properly initialised through Substructure_Remote_Init() and
 * Substructure_Remote_SetupClientSocket().
 *
 * \param[in]  Socket          An open TCP/IP socket with the PNSE server.
 * \param[in]  WhatToDo        Action that will be performed.
 *                             - OF_REMOTE_SETUP (2) Setup the connection with the OpenFresco server.
 *                             - OF_REMOTE_SET_TRIAL_RESPONSE (3) send the new state to the OpenFresco server.
 *                             - OF_REMOTE_GET_DAQ_RESPONSE (6) to request the DAQ response from the remote
 *                               site.
 *                             - OF_REMOTE_DIE (99) to tell OpenFresco that the test has finished. Frees
 *                               internal memory.
 * \param[in]  Size            Referenced when \f$WhatToDo = \{2,3,6\}\f$. It is the number of coupling
 *                             degrees of freedom that the remote site must handle.
 * \param[in]  Data_To_Send    Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 3\f$. It contains the data to be sent to the
 *                             remote site.
 * \param[out] Data_To_Receive Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 6\f$. On exit it contains the data received from
 *                             the remote facility.
 *
 * \post If any error occurs during the execution of this routine, like communication problems, the program
 * shows the appropiate error message befor exiting with \c EXIT_FAILURE.
