/**
 * \brief Calculates the new state.
 *
 * The displacement is computed according to the formulation using the effective stiffness matrix in page 53 of (\cite Dorka_1998). This is the implicit displacement.
 * 
 * \f[\overrightarrow{u_0} = \mathcal{K}^{-1}_e(\overrightarrow{f_{eff}} + \overrightarrow{l_i} + \overrightarrow{f(e)})\f]
 * 
 * \pre
 * - All elements of type \c MatrixVector must be properly initialised through the Init_MatrixVector() routine.
 * - \c Keinv must be a symmetrical matrix in general storage. Only the upper part will be referenced (lower part in FORTRAN).
 * - The size of the vectors and matrices must be coherent, since it will not be checked in the routine.
 * 
 * \param[in] Eff_ForceT the effective force vector \f$\overrightarrow{f_{eff}}\f$.
 * \param[in] In_Load the input load vector \f$\overrightarrow{l_i}\f$.
 * \param[in] Err_Force the error force vector coming from the PID controller \f$\overrightarrow{f(e)}\f$.
 * \param[in] PID_P the proportional part of the PID controller.
 * \param[in] Keinv the inverted effective stiffness matrix \f$\mathcal{K}^{1}_e\f$.
 * \param[in,out] Tempvec is a temporal vector that helps in the calculations. This is included in order to avoid allocating and deallocating memory each step. On input
 * only the number of rows is used.
 * \param[out] Disp0 is new implicit displacement \f$\overrightarrow{u_0}\f$.
 *
 * \post
 * - \c Disp0 is the result of the operation \f$\overrightarrow{u_0} = \mathcal{K}^{-1}_e(\overrightarrow{f_{eff}} + \overrightarrow{l_i} + \overrightarrow{f(e)})\f$.

 * \brief Joins the non-coupling of a vector.
 *
 * The non-coupling (\f$Order-OrderC\f$) part of the vector is added to the global vector of size (\f$Order\f$).
 * This routine makes use of the level 1 BLAS dcopy_().
 *
 * \pre
 * - The global vector (length \f$Order\f$) must be properly initialised through the Init_MatrixVector() routine.
 * - The vector of length \f$Order- OrderC\f$ must contain the non-coupling part that the global vector requires.
 * - The coupling nodes are assumed to be consecutive (the first node is assumed to be PosCouple).
 * - The number of rows of the vectors must be indicative of their length.
 * - \e Order is the number of rows and columns of the input matrix.
 * - \e OrderC is the number of coupling degrees of freedom.
 *
 * \param[in] VecXm The non-coupling part of the vector.
 * \param[in,out] Vec The global vector. As an input, only the size of the vector is referenced, not its elements.
 * \param[in] CNodes Structure containing the coupling nodes.
 *
 * \post
 * - \c Vec contains the non-coupling part of the vector, leaving the coupling nodes untouched.
