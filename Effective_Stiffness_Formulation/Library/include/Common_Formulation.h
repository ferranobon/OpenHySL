 * \brief Calculates the new state.
 *
 * The explicit part of the new state is computed. This routine does not depend on a specific formulation
 * and therefore it can be used in displacement, velocity and acceleration control formulations.
 * 
 * \f[\vec n_0^{t + \Delta t} = \mathcal{G}^{-1}(\vec f_{eff}^t + \vec l_i^t - \vec f_{err}^t)\f]
 *
 * where:
 * - \f$\vec n_0^{t + \Delta t}\f$ is the explicit part of the new state vector at time \f$t + \Delta t\f$,
 * - \f$\mathcal{G}\f$ is the gain matrix,
 * - \f$\vec f_{eff}^t\f$ is the effective force vector at time \f$t\f$,
 * - \f$\vec l_i^t\f$ is the input load vector at time \f$t\f$,
 * - and \f$\vec f_{err}^t\f$ is the error compensation force at time \f$t\f$.
 *
 * It makes use of BLAS routines to perform the lineal algebra operations.
 * 
 * \pre
 * - All elements of type \c MatrixVector_t must be properly initialised through the MatrixVector_Create() routine.
 * - \c Gain must be a symmetrical matrix in general storage. Only the upper part will be referenced (lower part in FORTRAN).
 * - The size of the vectors and matrices must be coherent since it will not be checked in the routine.
 * 
 * \param[in] IGain the inverted gain matrix \f$\mathcal{G}^{1}\f$.
 * \param[in] Eff_ForceT the effective force vector \f$\vec f_{eff}^t\f$.
 * \param[in] In_LoadT the input load vector \f$\vec l_i^t\f$.
 * \param[in] Err_ForceT the error force vector \f$\vec f_{err}^t\f$.
 * \param[in,out] Tempvec is a temporal vector that helps in the calculations. This is included in order to avoid
 * allocating and deallocating memory each step. On input only the number of rows is used.
 * \param[out] VecTdT_0 is new explicit state (displacement, velocity or acceleration depending on the selected formulation)
 * \f$\vec n_0^{t + \Delta t}\f$.
