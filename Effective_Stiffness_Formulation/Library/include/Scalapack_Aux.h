/**
 * \brief Initialises the descriptor vector (1D array) necessary for distributed matrices/vectors (ScaLAPACK
 * routine) with the 8 input arguments: <em>m, n, mb, nb, irsrc, icsrc, ictxt</em> and \em lld.
 *
 * \param[out] desc  The array descriptor of a distributed matrix/vector.
 * \param[in]  m     (global) Number of rows in the distributed matrix/vector. \f$m \geq 0\f$.
 * \param[in]  n     (global) Number of columns in the distributed matrix/vector. \f$m \geq 0\f$.
 * \param[in]  mb    (global) Blocking factor used to distribute the rows among processes. \f$mb \geq 1\f$.
 * \param[in]  nb    (global) Blocking factor used to distribute the columns among processes. \f$nb \geq 1\f$.
 * \param[in]  irsrc (global) The process row over which the first row of the matrix is distributed. \f$0 \leq
 *                   irsrc < nprow\f$, where \f$nprow\f$ is the number of process rows in the grid.
 * \param[in]  icsrc (global) The process column over which the first column of the matrix is
 *                   distributed. \f$0 \leq icsrc < npcol\f$, where \f$npcol\f$ is the number of process
 *                   columns in the grid.
 * \param[in]  ictxt (global) The BLACS context handle, indicating the global context of the operation on the
 *                   matrix. The context itself is glogal.
 * \param[in]  lld   (local) The leading dimension of the local array storing the local blocks of the
 *                   distributed matrix. \f$lld \geq max(1,LOCr(m))\f$, where LOCr() denotes the number of
 *                   elements of the matrix that a process would perceive if the matrix were distributed over
 *                   \f$p\f$ processes of its process column. It can be determined using numroc_(): \f$ LOCr(
 *                   m ) = numroc_( m, mb, myrow, irsrc, nprow)\f$ Where \f$myrow\f$ is contains the local
 *                   process (local value).
 * \param[out] info  On output if:
 *                   - \f$info = 0\f$: successful exit;
                     - \f$info < 0\f$: if \f$info = -i\f$ the \em i-th argument had an illegal value.
