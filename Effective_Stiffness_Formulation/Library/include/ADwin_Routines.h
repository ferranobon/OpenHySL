/**
 * \brief Sub-stepping process in ADwin.
 *
 * This routine communicates with ADwin to perform the sub-stepping process in ADwin. It does so by sending
 * the explicit displacement to the ADwin system. It waits a certain amount of time before retrieving the data
 * from the ADwin system. This is done in order to avoid overloading the system with network requests when the
 * system is not yet ready. A good time to get the data from ADwin is:
 *
 * \f[Time_To_Wait = \frac{Round Trip Time}{0.9}\f]
 *
 * Note that this value has to be coherent also with when ADwin measures the last coupling force from the
 * speciment.
 *
 * This routine relies on a synchronization variable when communicating with ADwin.
 * - When sending the data to ADwin, the first value of the array should be \c 1.0. This indicates the running
 *   process in ADwin that a new displacement value is available.
 * - If \f$ADwinReady = 0\f$ the sub-stepping process is not finished and therefore the last coupling force is
 *   not yet measured. The routine will keep asking ADwin for the last coupling force until the first received
 *   value from ADwin is equal to -1.0. When this happens the substepping process is finished.

 *
 * \pre
 * - ADwin must be successfully booted and the substepping process must be running.
 * - The sub-stepping process in ADwin should expect the new displacement vectors to be set in array 2. The
 *   first value should be a 1.0 in order to indicate that a new value is available.
 * - The sub-stepping process in ADwin should save the new displacement and force values on array 3. When the
 *   values are reaady (the sub-stepping process is finished) the first value should be a -1.0.
 * - A valid gain matrix of size \$OrderC\$x\$OrderC\$ should be on ADwin.
 * - Only the coupling elements should be on the given vectors since the routine does not consider the global
 *   position of the coupling degrees of freedom.
 *
 * \param[in]  VecTdT_0c    Explicit displacement at the begining of the step to be sent to ADwin. It should
 *                          be at least \f$Length \geq OrderC\f$.
 * \param[in]  OrderC       Amount of data to be sent to the ADwin system.
 * \param[in]  Time_To_Wait Amount of time that the computer should wait before asking ADwin for the first
 *                          time for the new values.
 * \param[out] VecTdT_c     Displacement at the end of the sub-stepping process. It should be at least
 *                          \f$Length \geq OrderC\f$.
 * \param[out] fcprev_c     Coupling forces measured at the sub-step \f$n_{sub} - 1\f$, where \f$n_{sub}\f$ is
  *                         the total number of sub-steps. It should be at least \f$Length \geq OrderC\f$.
 * \param[out] fc_c         Coupling forces measured at the sub-step \f$n_{sub}\f$. It should be at least
 *                          \f$Length \geq OrderC\f$.
 * 
 * \post The vectors \c VecTdT_c, \c fcprev_c, \c fc_c contain the last control values and the coupling force
 * at the previous and last sub-steps.
