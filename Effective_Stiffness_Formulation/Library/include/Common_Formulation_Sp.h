 * \brief Calculates the input load as absolute values. Sparse version.

 * This routine calculates the input load as absolute values that is required at the beginning of each step through:
 *
 * \f[\vec l_i^t = \mathcal{C} \dot{\vec u}_g + \mathcal{K} \vec u_g\f]
 *
 * where:
 * - \f$\vec l_i^t\f$ is the input load vector at time \f$t\f$
 * - \f$\mathcal{C}\f$ is the viscous damping matrix,
 * - \f$\dot{\vec u}_g\f$ is a vector with the ground velocity values,
 * - \f$\mathcal{K}\f$ is the stiffness matrix,
 * - \f$\vec u_g\f$ is a vector with the ground displacement values,
 *
 * It makes use of the BLAS and Sparse BLAS routines from the Intel Math Kernel Library (\cite MKL_2013) to
 * perform the linear algebra operations.

 * - All elements of type \c MatrixVector_t must be properly initialised through the MatrixVector_Create() routine.
 * - All elements of type \c MatrixVector_Sp_t must be properly intialised through the MatrixVector_Create_Sp() routine.
 * - The matrices must in Intel's MKL CSR-\em three \em array \em variation and in one based index.
 * - The matrices must be symmetrical and only the upper part will be referenced (lower part in FORTRAN routines).
 * - The dimensions of the matrices must be the identical.
 * - The dimensions of the vectors and matrices must be coherent since it will not be checked in the routine.
 * - The ground displacement and velocity vectors should have already the right values on the right position
 *   since the routine does not check if they are applied to the right degree of freedom.
