 *
 * This routine takes the available processes and assign, or map, them into a BLACS process grid (BLACS
 * routine). In other words, they establish how the BLACS coordinate system will map into the native machine's
 * process numbering system. Each BLACS grid is contained in a context (its own message passing universe), so
 * that it does not interfere with distributed operations which occur within other grids/contexts. These grid
 * creation routines may be called repeatedly in order to define additional contexts/grids. All BLACS codes
 * must call this routine, or its sister routine CBlacs_gridmap().
 *
 * This routine creates a simple NPROW x NPCOL process grid. This process grid will use the first NPROW
 * NPCOL processes, and assign them to the grid in a row- or column-major natural ordering. If these
 * process-to-grid mappings are unacceptable, BLACS_GRIDINIT's more complex sister routine Cblacs_gridmap()
 * must be called instead.
 *
 * Depending on the value of \c order, the processes are mapped to the BLACS grid using following ordering:
 * - \c order = 'R': row-major natural ordering;
 * - \c order = 'C': column-major natural ordering;
 * - Any other value will result in row-major natural ordering.
 *
 * \param[in,out] icontxt On input an integer handle indicating the system context to be used in creating the
 *                        BLACS context. On output, the integer handle to the created BLACS context. 
 * \param[in]     order   Indicates how to map processes to BLACS grid.
 * \param[in]     nprow   Indicates how many process rows the process grid should contain.
 * \param[out]    npcol   Indicates how many process columns the processs grid should contain.
