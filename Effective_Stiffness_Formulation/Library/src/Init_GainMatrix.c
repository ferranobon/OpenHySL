 * \version 1.0 PARDISO solver for matrix inversion is deprecated.
 * \date 9th of February 2013
 * 
 * \todo Add support for packed storage to reduce memory use.
 *
 * \brief Routines to compute the gain matrix.
 *
 * Routines for calculating the gain matrix. The routines make use of the BLAS and LAPACK libraries to perform the linear
 * algebra operations, including the matrix inversion in single and double precision. Sparse BLAS operations are supported
 * through the Intel MKL library, but since matrix inversion is a dense operations they still rely on LAPACK for this
 * operation. The PARDISO solver is no longer supported since it requires more memory and time than the LAPACK equivalent
 * routines.
