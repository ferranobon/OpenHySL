 *
 * \todo 
 * - Implement the asynchronous version to send/receive data from the server.
 * - Document the several NSEP packages.

/**
 * \brief Main routine to communicate with PNSE using the NSEP protocol as a CGM.
 *
 * This routine handles several aspects of the communication of a CGM with the PNSE server. It covers the aspects of
 * opening a socket, login, send and receive messages and to define the running status of the CGM in a compliant way with
 * the NSEP protocol. This is achieved through the \c WhatToDo variable.
 *
 * \pre
 * - A PNSE type server must be waiting for connections.
 *
 * \param[in] WhatToDo Action that will be performed.
 * - 0     Connect to the PNSE, login and set the state to running.
 * - 1     Send something to the server ( can be whatever ) NSEP_CMD Packet.
 * - 2     Request something from the server ( can be whatever ) NSEP_QUERY Packet.
 * - 3     Terminate Connection (NSEP_CLNSTATE packet).
 * \param[in] Time Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 1\f$. It contains the pseudo-time (experiment time) when the data to be sent
 * \c Data_To_Send was aquired or calculated.
 * \param[in] Data_To_Send Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 1\f$. It contains the data to be sent to the PNSE server.
 * \param[out] Data_To_Receive Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 2\f$. On exit it contains the data received from the server.
 * \param[in] Order Only referenced when \f$WhatToDo = 1\f$ or \f$WhatToDo = 2\f$. It is the amount of data that has to be
 * sent or received from the PNSE server.
 *
 * \post
 * - If any error occurs during the execution of this routine, like communication problems, the program shows the appropiate
 * error message befor exiting with EXIT_FAILURE.

 * \brief Login to the server in order to proceed with the test.

 * Routine that deals with the login process required by the NSEP protocol. It makes use of the routines Send_Login_Information()
 * and Receive_Login_Information() to deal with this process.
 *
 * \pre
 * - The TCP/IP connection with the PNSE server must be stablished.
 * - \c Login must be properly initialised through GetServerInformation and contain an account name and password.
 *
 * \param[in] Socket An open TCP/IP socket with the PNSE server.
 * \param[in] Send_Buffer The message to be sent to the server. In this case a __AP_LOGIN_REQUEST. Not referenced on entry,
 * although it must contain an initialised memory space.
 * \param[out] Receive_Buffer On exit this will contain the answer comming from the server regarding the login request.
 * \param[out] Error On exit it will contain the kind of error, if any, that ocurred within this routine.
 * - 0 No error ocurred.
 * - 1 Error during sending the message to the PNSE server.
 * - 2 Error while receiving the message from the PNSE server.
 * - 3 Error during the login process.
 *
 * \post A __AP_LOGIN_REQUEST is sent to the server and afterwards a __AP_LOGIN_REPLY is received. The routines inform through
 * \c Error the result of such operation.
