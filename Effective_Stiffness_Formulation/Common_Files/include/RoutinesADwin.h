 * \returns 1 if ADwin is loaded correctly and 0 otherwise.
 *
 * \post ADwin is loaded and ready to be used. In any other case, an appropiate

 * \brief Routine to perform the substepping process of Dorka's substructure
 * algorithm in ADwin.
 *
 * This routine performs the substepping process of Dorka's substructure
 * algorithm in ADwin considering displacement control.
 * In order to avoid changing each time the code in ADwin, the input and output
 * variables are always stored in the same space in the ADwin memory.
 *
 * \pre - ADwin must have, as a process running, the substepping part of Dorka's
 * substructure algorithm. The process in ADwin must look for the following
 * variables in:
 * - The vectors u0c, uc, fcprev and fc must be properly initialised and must be of length \f$L \geq OrderC\f$.
 *
 * \param[in] u0c      The implicit displacement resulting from the newmark integration process. This array
 *                       contains only the displacement of the coupling nodes.
 * \param[out] uc      Displacement containing the implicit and the explicit part at the final sub-step.
 * \param[out] fcprev  Measured force at the sub-step \f$ j \leq N_{sub\-step} - 1\f$. Used to compute the new
                         acceleration (Compute_Acceleration()) and velocity (Compute_Velocity()) in the main program. Only the coupling nodes are present.
 * \param[out] fc      Measured force at the final sub-step. Used in order to calculate the error force at the end
                         of the step (Compute_Force_Error()).
 * \param[in] OrderC   Order of the vectors. This is equal to the number of coupling degrees of freedom.
 *
 * \post ADwin will perform the substepping process in displacement control.

/**
 * \brief Reads the data from ADwin and stores it in a file.
 *
 * The data stored in the array 97 of ADwin is read and stored in a file named "Data.txt" with as many columns as
 * the number of channels (\c NUM_CHANNELS) and as many rows as \f$N_{steps}\cdot N_{substeps}\f$
 *
 * \pre Data must be a properly initialised array of length \f$L \geq N_{steps}\cdot N_{substeps}\cdot NUM\_CHANNELS\f$.
 *
 * \param[in] Num_Steps Number of steps. Variable involved in the amount of data to be read.
 * \param[in] Num_Sub Number of substeps. Variable involved in the amount of data to be read.
 * \param[out] Data Array to store the desired data
 *
 * \post Data.txt will contain the data stored in the array 97 of ADwin with:
 * - A header file with the names of the channels.
 * - Number of columns equal to \c NUM_CHANNELS.
 * - Number of rows equal to \f$N_{step}\cdot N_{substep}\f$.
