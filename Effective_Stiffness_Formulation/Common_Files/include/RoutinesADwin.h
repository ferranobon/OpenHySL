 * \param[in] Boot_Path Full path of the file to be used in order to boot ADwin.
 * \returns 1 if ADwin is loaded correctly and 0 otherwise.
 *
 * \post ADwin is loaded and ready to be used. In any other case, an appropiate

 * \brief Routine to perform the substepping process of Dorka's substructure
 * algorithm in ADwin.
 *
 * This routine performs the substepping process of Dorka's substructure
 * algorithm in ADwin. In this routine, displacement control is considered.
 * In order to avoid changing each time the code in ADwin, the input and output
 * variables are always stored in the same space in the ADwin memory.
 *
 * \pre ADwin must have, as a process running, the substepping part of Dorka's
 * substructure algorithm. The process in ADwin must look for the following
 * variables in:
 *
 * \param[in] u0c
 * \param[out] uc
 * \param[out] fcprev
 * \param[out] fc
 * \param[in] OrderC
 * \param[in] NSub Number of sub-steps in the sub-stepping process.
 * \param[in] Deltat_Sub 
 *
 * \post ADwin will perform the substepping process in displacement control.
