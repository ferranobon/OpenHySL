 * \brief Calculate force vector.
 *
 * The force vector is calculated according to \f$f_i = l_i + f_c + \Delta_f\f$, where:
 * - \f$f_i\f$ is the force vector.
 * - \f$l_i\f$ is the input load.
 * - \f$\Delta_f\f$ is the force due to the PID error compensator.
 * - \f$i\f$ denotes the step.
 *
 * \pre
 * - All elements of type MatrixVector must be properly initialised through the Init_MatrixVector() routine.
 * - The size of the vectors must be coeherent, since it will not be checked in the routine.
 * - The number of rows of the vector \f$f_i\f$ must be indicative of its length.
 *
 * \param[in, out] fi The force vector at step \e i. As an input, only the size of the vector is referenced, not its elements.
 * \param[in] fc The coupling force at step \e i.
 * \param[in] li The input load at step \e i.
 * \param[in] Deltaf The force due to the PID error compensator.
 *
 * \post
 * - \f$f_i\f$ is the result of the operation \f$f_i = l_i + f_c + \Delta_f\f$.
