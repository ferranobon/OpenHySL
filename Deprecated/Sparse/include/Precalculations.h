 * \brief Reads the velocity and displacement of an earthquake from a file.
 *
 * The data from an earthquake is readen from the specified file and its components are stored in different variables, namely:
 * displacement and velocity. If the specified file does not exist, an appropriate error is displayed
 * and the program exists with \c EXIT_FAILURE.
 *
 * \pre
 * - The input text file should be in ASCII format and it must contain no header and four columns in the following order:
 *     -# It can contain anything, since it will not be stored, it is recommended that it has the step number to detect any possible
 * errors (see the next precondition).
 *     -# Acceleration in \f$[m/s^2]\f$.
 *     -# Velocity in \f$[m/s]\f$.
 *     -# Displacement in \f$[m]\f$.
 * - Note also that the number of steps in the file should be equal to the number of steps defined in InitConstants(). No check
 * is performed.
 * - The arrays must be properly initialised and its length should be \f$l = Number~of~Steps\f$.
 *
 * \param[out] Velocity Array that will store the third column of the data file, that is, the velocity of the recorded earthquake.
 * \param[out] Displacement Array that will store the fourth column of the data file, that is, the displacement of the recorded earthquake.
 * \param[in] NumSteps The number of steps in which the earthquake is divided.
 * \param[in] Filename The name of the file where the earthquake is recorded.
 *
 * \post
 * - \c Velocity and \c Displacement will store the velocity and displacement of the recorded earthquake.
