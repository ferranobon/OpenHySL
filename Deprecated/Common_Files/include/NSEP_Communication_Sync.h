/**
 * \brief Main routine to communicate with PNSE using the NSEP protocol as a CGM or a FCM.
 *
 * This routine handles several aspects of the communication of a CGM or a FCM with the PNSE server. It covers the aspects of
 * opening a socket, login, send and receive messages and to define the running status of the CGM/FCM in a compliant way with
 * the NSEP protocol. This is achieved through the \c WhatToDo variable.
 *
 * \pre
 * - A PNSE type server must be waiting for connections.
 *
 * \param[in] WhatToDo Action that will be performed.
 * - 0     Connect to the PNSE, login and set the state to running.
 * - 1     Send a \c NSEP_CMD package to the server.
 * - 2     Request a \c NSEP_CSIG package from the server.
 * - 3     Request a \c NSEP_CMD package from the server.
 * - 4     Send a \c NSEP_CSIG package to the server.
 * - 5     Ask the server fo the experiment state (\c NSEP_EXPSTATE package).
 * - 6     Terminate the connection (\c NSEP_CLNSTATE packet with \c NSEP_CS_FINISHED).
 * \param[in] Time Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 1\f$ or \f$WhatToDo = 3\f$. It contains the pseudo-time (experiment time) when
 * the data is sent by the CGM or received by the FCM through a \c NSEP_CMD package.
 * \param[in] Data_To_Send Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 1\f$ (\c NSEP_CMD) or \f$WhatToDo = 4\f$ (\c NSEP_CSIG). It contains the
 * data to be sent to the PNSE server.
 * \param[out] Data_To_Receive Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 2\f$ (\c NSEP_CSIG), \f$WhatToDo = 3\f$ (NSEP_CMD) or
 * \f$WhatToDo = 5\f$. On exit it contains the data received from the server. This is not the case when \f$WhatToDo = 5\f$ since
 * it will be used to indicate the FCM that the process has finished \c Data_To_Receive[0] \c = \c -9999.0.
 * \param[in] Order Referenced when \f$WhatToDo \in [1,4]\f$. It is the amount of data that has to be sent or received from the
 * PNSE server.
 *
 * \post
 * - If any error occurs during the execution of this routine, like communication problems, the program shows the appropiate
 * error message befor exiting with \c EXIT_FAILURE.

/**
 * \brief Login to the server in order to proceed with the test.
 *
 * Routine that deals with the login process required by the NSEP protocol. It makes use of the routines Send_Login_Information()
 * and Receive_Login_Information() to deal with this process.
 *
 * \pre
 * - The TCP/IP connection with the PNSE server must be stablished.
 * - \c Login must be properly initialised through GetServerInformation() and contain an account name, password, the IP of the
 * server and the port used.
 *
 * \param[in] Socket An open TCP/IP socket with the PNSE server.
 * \param[in] Login It contains, the server IP, the port used during communication and an account name and its password.
 * \param[in] Send_Buffer The message to be sent to the server. In this case a \c __AP_LOGIN_REQUEST. Not referenced on entry,
 * although it must contain an initialised memory space.
 * \param[out] Receive_Buffer On exit this will contain the answer comming from the server regarding the login request.
 * \param[out] Error On exit it will contain the kind of error, if any, that ocurred within this routine.
 * - 0 No error ocurred.
 * - 1 Error during sending the message to the PNSE server.
 * - 2 Error while receiving the message from the PNSE server.
 * - 3 Error during the login process.
 *
 * \post \c A __AP_LOGIN_REQUEST is sent to the server and afterwards a \c __AP_LOGIN_REPLY is received. The routines inform through
 * \c Error the result of such operation.
