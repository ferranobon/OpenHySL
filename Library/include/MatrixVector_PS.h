/**
 * \brief Adds three matrices of the same dimensions.
 * 
 * \warning The effect of using this routine on vectors is unknown.
 *
 * This routine adds three matrices through the operation:
 *
 * \f[\mathcal Y = \alpha \mathcal A + \beta \mathcal B + \gamma \mathcal C\f]
 *
 * where:
 * - \f$\mathcal Y\f$, \f$\mathcal A\f$, \f$\mathcal B\f$, \f$\mathcal C\f$ are symmetric matrices,
 * - and \f$\alpha\f$, \f$\beta\f$, \f$\gamma\f$ are real scalars.
 *
 * It makes use of BLAS routines to perform the lineal algebra operations. For the full storage and sparse
 * version use the MatrixVector_Add3Mat() and MatrixVector_Add3Mat_Sp() routines respectively.
 *
 * \pre
 * - All elements of type \c Matrix must be properly initialised through MatrixVector_Create_PS().
 * - The matrices must be symmetrical and in packed storage with the upper part referenced (lower part in
 *   FORTRAN routines).
 * - \f$S(\mathcal Y) \geq max(S(\mathcal A),S(\mathcal B),S(\mathcal C))\f$ where \f$S(\mathcal X) =
 *   \frac{(X.Rows*X.Cols + X.Rows)}{2}\f$ is the size of the matrix. 
 * 
 * \param[in]     MatA  Symmetric matrix \f$\mathcal A\f$ in packed storage with the upper part referenced
 *                      (lower part in FORTRAN routines).
 * \param[in]     MatB  Symmetric matrix \f$\mathcal B\f$ in packed storage with the upper part referenced
 *                      (lower part in FORTRAN routines).
 * \param[in]     MatC  Symmetric matrix \f$\mathcal C\f$ in packed storage with the upper part referenced
 *                      (lower part in FORTRAN routines).
 * \param[in]     Const Scalars that multiply the matrices A (\f$\alpha\f$), \c Const.Aplha), B (\f$\beta\f$),
 *                      \c Const.Beta) and C (\f$\gamma\f$), \c Const.Gamma).
 * \param[in,out] MatY  Symmetric matrix \f$\mathcal Y\f$ in packed storage with the upper part referenced
 *                      (lower part in FORTRAN routines). On entry only the dimensions are referenced.
 *
 * \post \c MatY is the result of the operation:
 * \f[\mathcal Y = \alpha \mathcal A + \beta \mathcal B + \gamma \mathcal C\f]
