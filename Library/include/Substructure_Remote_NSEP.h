 * \brief Prototypes for the communication subroutines compliant with NSEP protocol and Definition of various
 * NSEP and PNSE constants
 *
 * This file contains the prototypes of the communication subroutines that are used when connecting to a PNSE
 * server type and the definition of the constants of the NSEP protocol. This definitions are used to identify
 * the type of message that is sent between NSEP compliant facilities.
 *
 * The information here presented regarding the different NSEP packages has been extracted from 
 * \cite Wang_2013. The reader will find more in depth information about the NSEP protocol specifications in
 * there.
 *
 * \todo 
 * - Implement the asynchronous version to send/receive data from the server.

/**
 * \brief Main routine to communicate with PNSE using the NSEP protocol as a CGM or a FCM.
 *
 * This routine handles several aspects of the communication of a CGM or a FCM with the PNSE server. It covers
 * the aspects of login, send and receive messages and to define the running status of the CGM/FCM in a
 * compliant way with the NSEP protocol. This is achieved through the \c WhatToDo variable.
 *
 * \pre
 * - A PNSE type server must be waiting for connections.
 * - \c Remote must be properly initialised through Substructure_Remote_Init() and
 * Substructure_Remote_SetupClientSocket().
 *
 * \param[in]  Remote          Substructure of type \c REMOTE_NSEP.
 * \param[in]  WhatToDo        Action that will be performed.
 *                             - \c NSEP_LOG (0) Connect to the PNSE, login and set the state to running.
 *                             - \c NSEP_SEND_CMD (1) Send a \c NSEP_CMD package to the server.
 *                             - \c NSEP_REQUEST_CSIG (2) Request a \c NSEP_CSIG package from the server.
 *                             - \c NSEP_REQUEST_CMD (3) Request a \c NSEP_CMD package from the server.
 *                             - \c NSEP_SEND_CSIG (4) Send a \c NSEP_CSIG package to the server.
 *                             - \c NSEP_REQUEST_STATE (5) Ask the server fo the experiment state (\c
 *                               NSEP_EXPSTATE package).
 *                             - \c NSEP_SET_TO_FINISHED (6) Terminate the connection (\c NSEP_CLNSTATE packet
 *                               with \c NSEP_CS_FINISHED).
 * \param[in]  Time            Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 1\f$ or \f$WhatToDo = 3\f$. It contains the
 *                             pseudo-time (experiment time) when the data is sent by the CGM or received by
 *                             the FCM through a \c NSEP_CMD package.
 * \param[in]  Size            Referenced when \f$WhatToDo \in [1,4]\f$. It is the amount of data that has to
 *                             be sent or received from the PNSE server.
 * \param[in]  Data_To_Send    Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 1\f$ (\c NSEP_CMD) or \f$WhatToDo = 4\f$ (\c
 *                             NSEP_CSIG). It contains the data to be sent to the PNSE server.
 * \param[out] Data_To_Receive Only used when \f$WhatToDo = 2\f$ (\c NSEP_CSIG), \f$WhatToDo = 3\f$ (NSEP_CMD)
 *                             or \f$WhatToDo = 5\f$. On exit it contains the data received from the
 *                             server. This is not the case when \f$WhatToDo = 5\f$ since it will be used to
 *                             indicate the FCM that the process has finished <tt>Data_To_Receive[0] =
 *                             -9999.0</tt>.
 *
 * \post If any error occurs during the execution of this routine, like communication problems, the program
 * shows the appropiate error message befor exiting with \c EXIT_FAILURE.
